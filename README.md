## Repository Contents

### 1. Detected-Patterns-By-PatternSight
- Contains **27 numbered folders**, each corresponding to a microservice system analyzed by PatternSight.
- Each folder includes:
  - **`.txt` file** listing 18 architectural patterns detected automatically, including their precise locations within the system files.
  - **`metamodel.json`** containing detailed static analysis information of the system, including files, APIs, dependencies, and extracted architectural components.

### 2. information-of-27-ms-systems.xlsx
- Contains metadata about the 27 systems, including:
  - System name and GitHub link
  - Number of microservices, files, and APIs
  - Total lines of code

### 3. MetamodelDefinition.pdf
- Provides detailed explanations of the metamodel components extracted from each system.
- Helps researchers understand the content of the `metamodel.json` files and their practical applications.

### 4. PatternSight-Ground-Truth.xlsx
- Contains **156 manually verified pattern instances** collected from the 27 systems.
- Serves as the **ground truth** for evaluating the accuracy and correctness of PatternSight's automated pattern detection.

## Purpose and Applications
- **Research analysis:** Investigate pattern adoption, assess the impact of design decisions on system quality, and study relationships between architecture and system properties such as scalability, fault tolerance, and maintainability.
- **Tool evaluation:** Validate the performance of PatternSight in detecting 18 microservice architectural patterns in real-world systems.
- **Future studies:** Provide reproducible data for statistical and algorithmic research in microservice architectural pattern detection.

## How to Use
1. Open the folders corresponding to each system to access the `.txt` and `metamodel.json` files.  
2. Refer to `information-of-27-ms-systems.xlsx` for general metadata about the systems.  
3. Read `MetamodelDefinition.pdf` to understand the extracted metamodel components.  
4. Use `PatternSight-Ground-Truth.xlsx` for evaluating the accuracy of pattern detection.
